These PINN hyperparameters then need to be tuned by optuna and one more optimzer. More details can be shared later during discussion. It has to be done using PyTorch Lightning and is little urgent. Could you help me with it? This message relates to: I will do CNN, rnn, lstm machine and deep learning projects H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 30, 2024, 9:18 PM Thank you so much for contacting me H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 30, 2024, 9:18 PM Yeah, we can do it as soon as possible can you please share with me your dataset H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 30, 2024, 9:20 PM And also share more details so we can achieve exactly which you need. S starter_python Jan 30, 2024, 9:25 PM Before I share the data I would like to ask few questions if that is okay with you H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 30, 2024, 9:25 PM Yeah please ask S starter_python Jan 30, 2024, 9:26 PM Have you worked with RNN before and do have expertise in PyTorch lightning? H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 30, 2024, 9:27 PM Yes i have great experience with RNN, lstm, GRU and Bart algorithms using both pytorch and tensor flow S starter_python Jan 30, 2024, 9:28 PM what about PyTorch lightning specifically? Have you used that? H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 30, 2024, 9:29 PM Yes but not that much like i have used in one or two projects. But dont worry about it i can handle it. I have good experience in these kind of work. S starter_python Jan 30, 2024, 9:33 PM Okay S starter_python Jan 30, 2024, 9:33 PM I will just share some task details with you and you can check if can do it or not H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 30, 2024, 9:33 PM okay perfect. please share it S starter_python Jan 30, 2024, 9:35 PM 1 File PINN task.docx (407.88 kB) S starter_python Jan 30, 2024, 9:36 PM Plz have a look at the details and let me know if you can provide PINN by thursday and tunning part by 04.02.24 H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 30, 2024, 9:37 PM Okay let me check S starter_python Jan 30, 2024, 9:41 PM Although it is assumed that the GPTs/copilot will not be used for creating code, but still I thought it is worth mentioning. Also, this is not the kindof task that GPT can help with H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 30, 2024, 9:42 PM Yeah I understand it, dont worry about it S starter_python Jan 30, 2024, 9:55 PM let me know once you have gone through complete details H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 30, 2024, 10:02 PM When you need this work done ? H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 30, 2024, 10:03 PM Also forward me an dataset S starter_python Jan 30, 2024, 10:03 PM Replied Me Jan 30, 2024, 10:02 PM When you need this work done ? PINN by thursday and tunning part by 04.02.24 H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 30, 2024, 10:04 PM Okay share with me your dataset S starter_python Jan 30, 2024, 10:05 PM Replied Me Jan 30, 2024, 10:03 PM Also forward me an dataset data is basically multiple csv files with 16 columns in it. The data is already pre-processed through feature engineering and already cleaned and hence only scaling and threshold needs to be applied H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 31, 2024, 10:04 AM Okay i will do that H huzi_electric_p Me Jan 31, 2024, 10:04 AM Please share the dataset]")
